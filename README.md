# Weedo-Tina2
The Weedo Tina2 is a small printer and very very very similar to the MP Cadet or Bresser Raptor. So maybe the releases also work for that printers.

# Real Filament holder printed on the Tina2
The filament holder on the side is a joke and won't fit for 1kg spools.
So just print your own better filament holder on the Tina2.
